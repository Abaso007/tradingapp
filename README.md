## Installation
Make sure you have NodeJS installed. You can check your Node.js version by running the command node -v in your terminal. If your version is older than 14.20.1, you will need to update Node.js. Please make sure that node -v gives you a version after 14.20.1 before doing anything else. 



go to the server folder
```sh
cd server
```


Then install the required packages for the server with:

```sh
npm install
```

go to the client folder
```sh
cd ..
```
```sh
cd client
```

Install the required packages for the client with:
```sh
npm install
```



Then you have to set up the .env files for the server and the client:
Go to the different services, create accounts and get the API keys

here  /tradingapp/server/config/ you have an example file. Rename it .env and change the keys with yours

there /tradingapp/client/  you have an example file. Rename it .env and change the keys with yours


Please make sure you have created a .env in the server AND in the client or it will not work

To use Vertex you will need to create /tradingapp/server/config/googlecredentials.json with your google credentials



Then you can start the server and the client

Go to the client folder

And run the client with:
```sh
npm run start
```

Open another terminal window and then run the server with:

Go to the server folder

```sh
npm run start
```
